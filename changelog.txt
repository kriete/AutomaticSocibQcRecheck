[11.07.2016]
Improved configuration to set desired year and month.
Added configuration to process only single stations (if desired).
Removed hard-coded paths.
Output directory must now be specified in the config.ini.
Prevented opening of new tabs in browser after processing a weather station.
Added possibility to use webgl for plotting (significantly faster rendering, but with some small visual "problems").
Removed toolbar from plots to prevent documented bug (11.07.) because of visual styling.
Added some configuration loading functions.
Tested with newest bokeh version (0.12).
